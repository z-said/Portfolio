These are the presentations from each of the 4 weeks of the Data Analysis Hands-on Training program offered by the German management consulting firm Kreativstorm. The business analytics topics covered in the 4 weeks include data cleaning, exploring data, parametric and non-parametric tests, correlation analysis, and regression. All of this was done using the IBM SPSS software. These projects were done as a group of 5 students and presented as a group by assigning a section for each of the students to present.
