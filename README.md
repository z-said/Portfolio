I am a student from Simon Fraser University who recently graduated with a bachelors degree majoring in Physics and minoring in Nuclear Science, with a certificate in Computing Studies.

Towards the end of my degree I became interested in Data Analytics as a career path. I have a lot of data analysis experience from my physics labs, however it was in the context of scientific research, not business analytics. I have also taken several computer science courses which is how I earned the Computing Studies certificate in addition to my degree. Also, I have an interest and am skilled in mathematics, having taken many math courses for my Physics degree. Some of the skills that I used the most during my degree, and that I think will be useful to me as a data analyst, are: problem solving, time management, being detail oriented, and teamwork.

Outside of school, I have completed a four-week Data Analysis Hands-on Training program from the German management consultant firm, Kreativstorm. I have also passed the SAS Base Programming Specialist performance-based exam where I earned the SAS Certified Specialist: Base Programming with SAS 9.4 certificate. Also, I have completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate which consisted of 10 online courses covering a range of topics in Data Science.

I wanted to choose a career path in a field where I could use my interests and my skills, and Data Analytics seems to fit those criteria for me.

This repository contains some examples of the data analysis projects that I have done and some of my physics work, which invoved data analysis but also writing, communication, and teamwork.
