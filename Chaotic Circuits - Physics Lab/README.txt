This is one of the labs from one of the Physics lab courses that I took during my bachelor's degree at Simon Fraser University. This lab involved studying chaos theory in the form of the chaotic behaviour exhibited by a non-linear curcuit. This involved building the circuit, collecting data, analyzing the data using python, and writing a technical report on the topic including the results and a discussion of the results. This was done with a lab partner so the lab and the python analysis were done collaboratively, however, the report was written individually.
