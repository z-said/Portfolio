This is an example of a budget spreadsheet using Microsoft Excel. It calculates the total monthly expenses and the savings based on the income. For any month, if the income is greater than the expenses then the entry in the savings row will be coloured green, if income is less than expenses then the entry in the savings row will be coloured red. It also calculates the total expenses, income, and savings for the 3-month period and also the monthly averages for each of those.
